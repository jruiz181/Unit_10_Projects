Title
00:01.000-->00:04.000
We observe today

00:04.001-->00:06.000
Not a victory of party,

00:06.001-->00:10.000
but a celebration of freedom -

00:10.001-->00:12.000
symbolizing an end,

00:12.001-->00:15.000
as well as a beginning

00:15.001-->00:17.000
signifying renewal,

00:17.001-->00:19.000
as well as change.

00:19.001-->00:22.000
For I have sworn before you

00:22.001-->00:24.000
and Almighty God

00:24.001-->00:27.000
the same solemn oath

00:27.001-->00:30.000
our forbears prescribed

00:30.001-->00:33.001
nearly a three-quaters ago.
